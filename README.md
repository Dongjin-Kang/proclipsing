## [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) Plugin for [Processing](http://processing.org)

**Note:** This repository was imported from the [SVN repository on Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/) on Nov. 16, 2014, and is not an official fork.

This Eclipse plugin bootstraps the creation of an Eclipse Java project that relies on the Processing .jar dependencies. This is different from the [processing-eclipse](http://github.com/processing/processing-eclipse) experiment, which adheres to the PDE / codegen approach found in the Processing IDE itself.
